# Weather-App
I have developed a web application using CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript that provides users with real-time weather forecast information through the OpenWeather API. The application dynamically displays weather data based on the user's geographical location. By utilizing latitude and longitude coordinates, the app accurately determines the user's current city or location within a country.

The user interface is designed using HTML5 and CSS, providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience. The main feature of the application is the real-time weather display, which is fetched from the OpenWeather API. Users can view details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

One of the unique features of this application is the ability to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature units. When users click on the temperature display, the app seamlessly switches between the two units, making it convenient for users to understand the weather data in their preferred format.

To achieve this, I've implemented JavaScript to handle the interaction and data retrieval. The application uses the fetch() function to make asynchronous requests to the OpenWeather API and retrieve weather data in JSON format. The app then processes and displays this data dynamically on the user interface.

By integrating latitude and longitude coordinates, the application not only offers weather information but also determines the user's approximate location in terms of city and country. This added functionality enhances the user experience and provides context to the weather data being presented.

Overall, this web application demonstrates the effective use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and feature-rich platform for accessing real-time weather forecasts. The integration of the OpenWeather API and the interactive temperature unit toggle adds value and interactivity to the user experience, making it an informative and engaging tool for staying updated on weather conditions.
